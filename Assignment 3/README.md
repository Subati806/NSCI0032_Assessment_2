# Assignment 3 - NSCI0032

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for Assignment 3 of NSCI0032.

We constructed and visualised the conventional and primitive unit cells of:

- Simple Cubic (SC)
- Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)
- Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)

We also created 4×4×4 supercells for each structure and visualised them using NGLView.

Each notebook is based on code from L6–L8 Bravais lectures, with extensions for visual clarity (e.g. add_unitcell).
